# improved-barnacle

This code demonstrates the usage of classes and multiple files in C++. It defines a Rectangle class with member variables width and length, and member functions to set and get these variables, and calculate the area. The main function prompts the user to choose between finding the area or volume, then prompts for user input to calculate the area or volume of a rectangle or box using the Rectangle and Box classes. The program validates the user input to ensure only valid values are used.
